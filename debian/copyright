 Parallelizable Open source Efficient Multibody Software (POEMS) is

 This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
 saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Rensselaer
 Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is

 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library/code or any derivative work under
 copyright law.
 .
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it including any associated interface
 definition files, and scripts used to control compilation and
 installation of the library.

    source code repository maintained by Rensselaer Polytechnic
    Institute.  The mechanics of the submission are explained in the
    file named CONTRIBUTE distributed with the Library. Should you
    decide to submit the changes, you agree to provide Rensselaer
    Polytechnic Institute with a joint copyright assignment of the
    changes, and you agree to sign such a copyright assignment form at
    the request of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Changes will then
